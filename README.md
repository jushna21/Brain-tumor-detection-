🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning and Gradio This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for classifying brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses a simple and interactive Gradio interface to allow users to upload MRI images and receive predictions in real-time.

🚀 Features Deep Learning model trained to classify brain tumor types.

Easy-to-use web interface using Gradio.

Supports image upload and returns the predicted tumor type.

Simple and interpretable code in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

🧾 Requirements Install the required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt Key Libraries Used:

TensorFlow / Keras

Gradio

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV

📁 Files gradio_brain_tumor_classifications-1.ipynb: Main notebook with model training and Gradio integration.

README.md: Project documentation.

(Optional) requirements.txt: List of Python packages required.

🔍 How to Use Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-classification.git cd brain-tumor-classification Run the notebook gradio_brain_tumor_classifications-1.ipynb step-by-step.

At the end of the notebook, a Gradio UI will launch. Upload an MRI image and get predictions instantly!

📊 Dataset The dataset used consists of MRI brain scan images labeled by tumor type. (Include source if open dataset is used, e.g., Kaggle Brain MRI Dataset).

🖼️ Output

A sample interface showing prediction results for uploaded brain scan images.

✅ Future Enhancements Deploy the Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.

Use a more complex CNN or transfer learning (e.g., MobileNet, VGG16).

Add explanations using Grad-CAM or SHAP for better interpretability.
